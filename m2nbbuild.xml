    There exist some targets which are by default empty and which can be 
    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
    before and after some main targets. They are: 

      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties
      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties
      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products

    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)

    Example of updating the n2nbbuild.properties file before lauching the 
    netbeans build to set the user level properties like jbi.as.home etc from
    the environment variables could look like this:

        <target name="-pre-init">
            <property environment="env"/>
            <propertyfile file="m2build.properties" >
                <entry  key="jbi.as.home" value="${env.AS_INSTALL}"/>
            </propertyfile>
        </target>
        
    --> 
    
</project>
